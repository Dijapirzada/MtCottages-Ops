	• 3 Qs: Quickness, Quality, Quantity
	• The Q depends on the boss. Needs to change gear immediately when asked at an instant.
	• For hospitality it should be Quickness. Otherwise the client will be talking to another landlord asap.
	• Programming is Quality.
	• Call them immediately because they must be impatient because they need last minute bookings.
	• Text first then after sending do the email after. It's faster that way.
	• Reply immediately after 1 minute and be conversational. Use their name and make sure it's the right spelling!
	• Make sure you already know which properties are available and not, so that you know which to recommend.
	• You should know how far it is from their working place. Also what other nice spots in the area.
	• Dream with them!
	• Call until they block you or tell you they've found another place to stay.
	• Wealth is the transfer of money and energy from the impatient to the patient.
	• Mt Cottages partners with the House Owners. It's just an agency so you may not know all the exact details.
	• Keycheck.com we're using that and owned by Furnished Finders. So make sure your stories has a lot of facts about the area so she won't think you're a scam. We can invite our clients to some holiday events with our Family like Thanksgiving and Christmas.
	• Hospitality is like doing a very personal relationship.
	• If client wants to move forward then you, tell them that you can book with the client and we don't do direct money transactions or ask payment details. It should be with KeyCheck and they might ask her to create her own account there and it's owned by FurnishedFinders if they found us at FurnishedFinders.
	• We can do a month to month or 3 months pay. Keycheck will ask this.
	• Tell them they might lose their property the next month if they book monthly. Because it might get booked by another.

Time is of the Essence!
	1. Text the person! It's the fastest way. Do it in 1 minute or less.
	May use the script:
	
	Hi ____, this is _____ with Mt Cottages. We have a few properties that we would like to discuss with you based on your inquiry from (Furnished Finder/AirBnB). Is now a good time to call?
	
	(If client answers that they're not available and suggested a time, then answer below)
	
	Yes, I will call you at __(time)__. Talk to you then ____!
	
	2. Call if they don't reply. Call multiple times until they tell you they found a place. If you get a hold of them, then keep them on the phone. 
	3. Prepare the email if the person gave their email address aside from texting. Find that script! Tell the group about it too.
	4. Did you do your calls?
	5. Make sure you put in your calendar the Client's availability to call if they mentioned it.
	6. Look at the availability of the properties. 
	7. Make sure you have at least an overview what each property has to offer (amenities and the environment it is in and some history that can work for them) and make a quick search the driving time from the house to their working area.
	8. We can mold each property according to client's needs, listen to their needs! Do your Requirement Engineering!
	9. And upsell our properties! 

	Do this as secondary only that you can do negotiations for the availability times. Like if the person wanted to book Parkersburg then they can transfer if they want once it's available if we put them in Marietta first.
