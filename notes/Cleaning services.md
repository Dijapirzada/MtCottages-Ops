### Benefits of Hiring a Professional House Cleaner
Ever tried to clean your rental units by yourself? If you have, then you will know the task can be quite daunting and demanding and may end up looking ‘not quite right’. So, if you are still on the fence in regards to hiring professional cleaning services, here are 5 reasons to help you make the decision.

1. Helps establish a good landlord-tenant relationship
There is no denying it; a good relationship with your tenant is key to your rental business’s success. High-quality tenants are always looking for high-quality living standards. Good cleaning companies provide superior work and fast response times to help you in this regard.

2. Leads to improved tenant retention for your rental properties
Tenant retention is one of the most cost-effective strategies you can implement. This is essential because tenant turnovers are expensive. A high tenant turnover means you’re not collecting a monthly rent payment, but are still paying a mortgage.

Hiring a good cleaning service can help you improve your tenant retention. Delegating the cleaning task to take up the move-in and move-in cleaning can help free up your time to do other important things.

3. Helps fill your vacancies much faster
Rental vacancies can kill cash flow for a real estate investor. Fortunately, there are a couple of ways to reduce them. Among these is hiring a professional cleaning company, especially when a tenant moves out.

While most leases require tenants to leave the premises clean when they vacate, some tenants don’t. This may leave your property looking unattractive to prospective tenants. Professional cleaners can help bring their lost glory back.
